# My Niri Dots

> Though I'm not yet sure if this can be called a dotfile since it's so simple.

Every time when I re-install my PC, I always feels like to try some new dotfiles. But as I searched through Internet the dotfiles I found were whether not stable or deeply customized and hard to make changes.

So I began the long and time-costing Niri customization.

I want it to be simple, reliable, easy and good-looking. As I'm not expert in designing and I'm super confident about doing bad in color design, the components I use are mainly simple modifications based on other peoples work (which are listed below).

This dot is really simple, and especially easy to make adjustments if you like. It provides an out-of-the box interface so you don't need to spend the whole afternoon adjusting corner radius and fighting against the hard-to-remember CSS code.

Okay so lets talk about how to use.

## Installation

The installation script currently only supports Arch Linux if you are starting from a clean system installation environment.
